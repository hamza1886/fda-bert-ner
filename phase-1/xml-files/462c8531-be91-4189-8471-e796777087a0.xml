                        <paragraph>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see <linkHtml href="#b593cbea-d8c8-4b50-9dba-e857c329eeff">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of a Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance (see <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>; also see <linkHtml href="#b64bb167-9594-473d-9752-3bd47502a3c1">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C<sub>max</sub> is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>). Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced (see <linkHtml href="#b64bb167-9594-473d-9752-3bd47502a3c1">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#b589574a-b914-4464-9076-2f6adc9a3cb8">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 29-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP and glyburide, alone and in combination, was conducted in obese patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to achieve adequate glycemic control while on maximum doses of glyburide (baseline FPG of approximately 250 mg/dL) (see <content styleCode="bold">Table 3</content>). Patients randomized to the combination arm started therapy with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg. At the end of each week of the first four weeks of the trial, these patients had their dosages of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP increased by 500 mg if they had failed to reach target fasting plasma glucose. After week four, such dosage adjustments were made monthly, although no patient was allowed to exceed Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP 2500 mg. Patients in the Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP only arm (metformin plus placebo) followed the same titration schedule. At the end of the trial, approximately 70% of the patients in the combination group were taking Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP 2000 mg/glyburide 20 mg or Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP 2500 mg/glyburide 20 mg. Patients randomized to continue on glyburide experienced worsening of glycemic control, with mean increases in FPG, PPG, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 14 mg/dL, 3 mg/dL, and 0.2%, respectively. In contrast, those randomized to Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP (up to 2500 mg/day) experienced a slight improvement, with mean reductions in FPG, PPG, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 1 mg/dL, 6 mg/dL, and 0.4%, respectively. The combination of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP and glyburide was effective in reducing FPG, PPG, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels by 63 mg/dL, 65 mg/dL, and 1.7%, respectively. Compared to results of glyburide treatment alone, the net differences with combination treatment were -77 mg/dL, - 68 mg/dL, and -1.9%, respectively (see <content styleCode="bold">Table 3</content>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A second double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=51), with 16 weeks of randomized treatment, demonstrated that in patients with type 2 diabetes controlled on insulin for 8 weeks with an average HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.46 ± 0.97%, the addition of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP maintained similar glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c </sub>7.15 ± 0.61 versus 6.97 ± 0.62 for Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP plus insulin and placebo plus insulin, respectively) with 19% less insulin versus baseline (reduction of 23.68 ± 30.22 versus an increase of 0.43 ± 25.20 units for Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP plus insulin and placebo plus insulin, p&lt;0.01). In addition, this study demonstrated that the combination of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP plus insulin resulted in reduction in body weight of 3.11 ± 4.30 lbs, compared to an increase of 1.30 ± 6.08 lbs for placebo plus insulin, p=0.01.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 24-week, double-blind, randomized study of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, taken twice daily (with breakfast and evening meal), was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had been treated with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP 500 mg twice daily for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry. The Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP dose had not necessarily been titrated to achieve a specific level of glycemic control prior to study entry. Patients qualified for the study if HbA<sub>1c</sub> was ≤8.5% and FPG was ≤200 mg/dL.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels &gt;5 mcg/mL are generally found.</content>

                              <content styleCode="bold">The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient’s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism.

Decreases in glyburide AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain (see <linkHtml href="#be822b43-f37b-408a-bb77-03640e4afaf0">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients</linkHtml>)<content styleCode="bold">.</content>

Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C<sub>max</sub> by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Cationic drugs</content>—Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Other</content>—Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> tests: Ames test (<content styleCode="italics">S. typhimurium</content>), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> mouse micronucleus test were also negative.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP. Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about two and six times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been established in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years (studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years). Use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years with type 2 diabetes, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults. (See <linkHtml href="#b8e7e5a6-f5e3-420d-9ba2-317cd05c66e6">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pediatric Clinical Studies</linkHtml>.) In this study, adverse effects were similar to those described in adults. (See <linkHtml href="#b4cc0200-d98e-4806-aa38-1956ade12f77">ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients</linkHtml>.) A maximum daily dose of 2000 mg is recommended.

                        <paragraph>Controlled clinical studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function, Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP should only be used in patients with normal renal function (see <linkHtml href="#b17c224b-9472-4653-a548-2651d7458307">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#b64bb167-9594-473d-9752-3bd47502a3c1">WARNINGS</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="#b8f96a24-2be7-482f-8d9e-9eb7cc158b82">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</linkHtml>). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP (see also <linkHtml href="#b64bb167-9594-473d-9752-3bd47502a3c1">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#b589574a-b914-4464-9076-2f6adc9a3cb8">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases (see <linkHtml href="#b64bb167-9594-473d-9752-3bd47502a3c1">WARNINGS</linkHtml>). Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin hydrochloride should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin hydrochloride should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During treatment initiation and dose titration (see <linkHtml href="#b085d075-1a6b-46de-8eee-6315d955ca45">Recommended Dosing Schedule</linkHtml>), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. <content styleCode="bold">The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin.</content>

                  <paragraph>Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals.

Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, metformin hydrochloride may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day.

                        <paragraph>If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With concomitant metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on metformin hydrochloride 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of metformin hydrochloride and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and plasma glucose response (see <linkHtml href="#bd3aba1f-904e-4a84-9125-de6c3dcdaeeb">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies</linkHtml>). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride therapy. Metformin hydrochloride therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2500 mg for metformin hydrochloride. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP are used to treat type 2 diabetes. This is also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. People with type 2 diabetes are not able to make enough insulin or respond normally to the insulin their bodies make. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems including kidney damage, amputations, and blindness. Diabetes is also closely linked to heart disease. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of medicines taken by mouth, and by insulin shots. Before you take Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, try to control your diabetes by exercise and weight loss. While you take your diabetes medicine, continue to exercise and follow the diet advised for your diabetes. No matter what your recommended diabetes management plan is, studies have shown that maintaining good blood sugar control can prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as blindness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP can help control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb. Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP do not cause your body to make more insulin. Because of this, when taken alone, it rarely cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and usually do not cause weight gain. However, when it is taken with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, hypoglycemia is more likely to occur, as is weight gain.</paragraph>
