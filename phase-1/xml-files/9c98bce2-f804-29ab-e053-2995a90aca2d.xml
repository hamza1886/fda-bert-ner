                  <paragraph>WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin  associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin  associated   lactic   acidosis   was   characterized   by    elevated    blood    lactate    levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.7), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].     </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>5.1 Lactic Acidosis</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin  associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
  <br/>
Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].
  <br/>
Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
  <br/>
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
  <br/>
In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>  Drug interactions —The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.
  <br/>
  Age 65 or greater —The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.
  <br/>
  Radiologic studies with contrast —Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging   procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.
  <br/>
  Surgery and other procedures —Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.
  <br/>
  Hypoxic states —Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.
  <br/>
  Excessive alcohol intake —Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.
  <br/>
  Hepatic impairment —Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Table 3 presents clinically significant drug interactions with metformin hydrochloride tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets
  <br/>
Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors
  <br/>
Clinical Impact:
  <br/>
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk for lactic acidosis.
  <br/>
Intervention:
  <br/>
Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.
  <br/>
Examples:
  <br/>
Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide.
  <br/>
Drugs that Reduce metformin hydrochloride tablet Clearance
  <br/>
Clinical Impact:
  <br/>
Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
  <br/>
Intervention:
  <br/>
Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with metformin hydrochloride tablets.
  <br/>
Examples:
  <br/>
Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine.
  <br/>
Alcohol
  <br/>
Clinical Impact:
  <br/>
Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.
  <br/>
Intervention:
  <br/>
Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.
  <br/>
Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin
  <br/>
Clinical Impact:
  <br/>
Coadministration of metformin hydrochloride tablets with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
  <br/>
Intervention:
  <br/>
Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin.
  <br/>
Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control
  <br/>
Clinical Impact:
  <br/>
Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control.
  <br/>
Intervention:
  <br/>
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia.
  <br/>
Examples:
  <br/>
Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>8.1 Pregnancy</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Risk Summary</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Limited data with metformin hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 5-times, respectively, a 2550 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C &gt;7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a HbA1C &gt; 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Considerations</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Data</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Human Data</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Published data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Animal Data</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.2 Lactation</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Risk Summary</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data]. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for metformin hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Data</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11 % to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride tablets may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.4 Pediatric Use</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old. Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years old.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this study, adverse reactions were similar to those described in adults. A maximum daily dose of 2000 mg of metformin hydrochloride tablets is recommended. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2).]</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.5 Geriatric Use</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.6 Renal Impairment</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.7 Hepatic Impairment</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>12.1 Mechanism of Action</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Absorption</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 to 1500 mg and 850 to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 μg/mL.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following a single oral dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, Cmax is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Peak plasma levels are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is comparable to metformin hydrochloride tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>At steady state, the AUC and Cmax are less than dose proportional for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets within the range of 500 to 2000 mg administered once daily. Peak plasma levels are approximately 0.6, 1.1, 1.4 and 1.8 mcg/mL for 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg once-daily doses, respectively. The extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets  at a 2000 mg once-daily dose is similar to the same total daily dose administered as metformin hydrochloride tablets 1000 mg twice daily. After repeated administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, metformin did not accumulate in plasma.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Effect of food: Food decreases the extent of absorption and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin hydrochloride tablets with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Distribution</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metabolism</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Elimination</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Specific Populations</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal Impairment</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Hepatic Impairment</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Geriatrics</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 4). [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2550 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph> Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2550 mg based on body surface area comparisons.</paragraph>

Mean change in body weight from baseline to week 29 was -1.4 lbs and -2.4 lbs in the metformin hydrochloride tablets and placebo arms, respectively. A 29-week, double -blind, placebo-controlled study of metformin hydrochloride tablets and glyburide, alone and in combination, was conducted in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had failed to achieve adequate glycemic control while on maximum doses of glyburide (baseline FPG of approximately 250 mg/dL). Patients randomized to the combination arm started therapy with metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg. At the end of each week of the first 4 weeks of the trial, these patients had their dosages of metformin hydrochloride tablets increased by 500 mg if they had failed to reach target fasting plasma glucose. After week 4, such dosage adjustments were made monthly, although no patient was allowed to exceed metformin hydrochloride tablets 2500 mg. Patients in the metformin hydrochloride tablets only arm (metformin plus placebo) discontinued glyburide and followed the same titration schedule. Patients in the glyburide arm continued the same dose of glyburide. At the end of the trial, approximately 70% of the patients in the combination group were taking metformin hydrochloride tablets 2000 mg/glyburide 20 mg or metformin hydrochloride tablets 2500 mg/glyburide 20 mg. The results are displayed in Table 8.</paragraph>
