                     <content styleCode="bold">Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic 
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release 
Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic 
acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic 
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant 
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated 
blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte 
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate 
ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin 
plasma levels &gt;5 μg/mL are generally found.</content>

receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 
patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). 
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant 
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal 
hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical 
problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart 
failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or 
acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, 
are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases 
with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic 
acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of 
renal function in patients taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (metformin 
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose 
of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. In particular, treatment of the elderly 
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of 
age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function 
is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic 
acidosis. In addition, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be promptly 
withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, 
dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly 
limit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should 
generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic 
disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either 
acute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, since alcohol 
potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In 
addition, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be temporarily discontinued 
prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure 
(see also <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>).</content>

                     <content styleCode="bold">The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and 
accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory 
distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may 
be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more 
marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the 
possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to 
notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>). FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be 
withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood 
glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin 
levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common 
during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence 
of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious 
disease.</content>

hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good 
hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the 
acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in 
prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also <linkHtml href="#section-6">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>).</content>

               <title>SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND PERFORMANCE</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> was developed as an extended-release 
formulation of metformin hydrochloride and designed for once-a-day oral 
administration using the patented single-composition osmotic technology (SCOT™). 
The tablet is similar in appearance to other film-coated oral administered 
tablets but it consists of an osmotically active core formulation that is 
surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. Two laser drilled exit ports exist in 
the membrane, one on either side of the tablet. The core formulation is composed 
primarily of drug with small concentrations of excipients. The semipermeable 
membrane is permeable to water but not to higher molecular weight components of 
biological fluids. Upon ingestion, water is taken up through the membrane, which 
in turn dissolves the drug and excipients in the core formulation. The dissolved 
drug and excipients exit through the laser drilled ports in the membrane. The 
rate of drug delivery is constant and dependent upon the maintenance of a 
constant osmotic gradient across the membrane. This situation exists so long as 
there is undissolved drug present in the core tablet. Following the dissolution 
of the core materials, the rate of drug delivery slowly decreases until the 
osmotic gradient across the membrane falls to zero at which time delivery 
ceases. The membrane coating remains intact during the transit of the dosage 
form through the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted in the feces.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in 
patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma 
glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes 
of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose 
production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin 
sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike 
sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with 
type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see <content styleCode="bold">
                              <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>
                           </content>) and does not cause 
hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged 
while fasting plasma insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may 
actually decrease.</paragraph>

as immediate-release metformin 1000 mg given twice daily. The geometric mean 
ratios (FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>/ immediate-release metformin) of 
AUC<sub>0-24hr</sub>, AUC<sub>0-72hr</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-inf.</sub> for these five studies ranged from 0.96 to 1.08.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Distribution studies with FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> have not been 
conducted. However, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin 
following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin 850 mg averaged 654 ± 
358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to 
sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into 
erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and 
dosing schedules of immediate-release metformin, steady state plasma 
concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally 
less than 1 μg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of immediate-release metformin, 
maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 μg/mL, even at maximum doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Metabolism studies with FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> have not 
been conducted. Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate 
that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic 
metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary 
excretion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy nondiabetic adults (N=18) receiving 2500 mg q.d. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, the percent of the metformin dose excreted in urine over 24 
hours was 40.9% and the renal clearance was 542 ± 310 mL/min. After repeated 
administration of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, there is little or no 
accumulation of metformin in plasma, with most of the drug being eliminated via 
renal excretion over a 24-hour dosing interval. The t<sub>1/2</sub> 
was 5.4 hours for FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Renal clearance of metformin (<content styleCode="bold">

2</linkHtml>
                           </content>) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, 
which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin 
elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed 
drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma 
elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination 
half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may 
be a compartment of distribution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of immediate-release 
metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of 
metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C<sub>max</sub> is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From 
these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging 
is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (<content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>In a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter 
U.S. clinical study, which compared FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> q.d. to 
immediate-release metformin b.i.d., 680 patients with type 2 diabetes who had 
been taking metformin-containing medication at study entry were randomly 
assigned in equal numbers to double-blind treatment with either FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> or immediate-release metformin. Doses were adjusted during 
the first six weeks of treatment with study medication based on patients' FPG 
levels and were then held constant over a period of 20 weeks. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline 
to endpoint. The primary objective was to demonstrate the clinical 
non-inferiority of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> compared to 
immediate-release metformin on the primary endpoint.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and metformin patients had mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> changes from baseline to endpoint equal to +0.40 and +0.14, 
respectively (<content styleCode="bold">

                           </content>). The 
least-square (LS) mean treatment difference was 0.25 (95% CI = 0.14, 0.37) 
demonstrating that FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> was clinically similar to 
metformin according to the pre-defined criterion to establish efficacy.</paragraph>

FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and immediate-release patients, respectively,

to receive immediate-release metformin plus insulin achieved a reduction in 
HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 2.10%, compared to a 1.56% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> achieved by insulin plus placebo. The improvement in 
glycemic control was achieved at the final study visit with 16% less insulin, 
93.0 U/day versus 110.6 U/day, immediate-release metformin plus insulin versus 
insulin plus placebo, respectively, p=0.04.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic 
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release 
Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic 
acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic 
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant 
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated 
blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte 
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate 
ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin 
plasma levels &gt;5 μg/mL are generally found.</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients 
receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 
patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). 
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant 
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal 
hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical 
problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart 
failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or 
acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, 
are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases 
with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic 
acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of 
renal function in patients taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (metformin 
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose 
of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. In particular, treatment of the elderly 
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of 
age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function 
is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic 
acidosis. In addition, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be promptly 
withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, 
dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly 
limit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should 
generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic 
disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either 
acute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, since alcohol 
potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In 
addition, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be temporarily discontinued 
prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure 
(see also <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>).</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and 
accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory 
distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may 
be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more 
marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the 
possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to 
notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>). FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be 
withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood 
glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin 
levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common 
during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence

increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% 
increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in 
elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on 
cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical 
(except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of

Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic 
control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, 
phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, 
nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood 
glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, the patient should be observed closely for 
hypoglycemia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and 
metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose 
interaction studies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less 
likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, 
sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, 
which are extensively bound to serum proteins.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term carcinogenicity studies with metformin have been 
performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 
weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum 
recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female 
mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in 
male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine 
polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There was no evidence of mutagenic potential of metformin in the following 
<content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> tests: Ames test (<content styleCode="italics">S. 
typhimurium</content>), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal 
aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the <content styleCode="italics">in 
vivo</content> mouse micronucleus test were also negative.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when 
administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three 
times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area 
comparisons.</paragraph>

levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital 
abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to 
maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Because animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
needed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with 
immediate-release metformin or FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. Metformin was 
not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This 
represents an exposure of about two and six times the maximum recommended human 
daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and 
rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a 
partial placental barrier to metformin.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches 
levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in 
nursing mothers. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may 
exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the 
mother. If FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> is discontinued, and if diet alone 
is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be 
considered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No pediatric clinical studies have been conducted with 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. The safety and effectiveness of 
immediate-release metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been 
established in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years (studies have not been 
conducted in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years). Use of 
immediate-release metformin in this age group is supported by evidence from 
adequate and well-controlled studies of immediate-release metformin in adults 
with additional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients ages 
10-16 years with type 2 diabetes, which demonstrated a similar response in 
glycemic control to that seen in adults (see <content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>Of the 389 patients who received FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> 
in controlled Phase III clinical studies, 26.5% [103/389] were 65 years and 
older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between 
these patients and younger patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Controlled clinical studies of immediate-release metformin did not include 
sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond 
differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience 
has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and 
because of the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in 
patients with impaired renal function, immediate-release metformin should only 
be used in patients with normal renal function (see <content styleCode="bold">

aging is associated with reduced renal function, immediate-release metformin 
should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose 
selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal 
function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose 
of immediate-release metformin (see also <content styleCode="bold">

fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near 
normal by using the lowest effective dose of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, 
either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or 
insulin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit 
detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the 
maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an 
adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of 
effectiveness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Short-term administration of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> may be 
sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually 
well-controlled on diet alone.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Recommended Dosing Schedule<paragraph>The usual starting dose of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> 
(metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets is 1000 mg taken with a full 
glass of water once daily with the evening meal, although 500 mg may be utilized 
when clinically appropriate. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 
500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2500 mg once daily with the evening meal (see

                  <paragraph>In randomized trials, patients currently treated with immediate-release 
metformin were switched to FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. Results of this 
trial suggest that patients receiving immediate-release metformin treatment may 
be safely switched to FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> once daily at the same 
total daily dose, up to 2500 mg once daily. Following a switch from 
immediate-release metformin to FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, glycemic 
control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly (see

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy<paragraph>When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents 
other than chlorpropamide to FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, no transition 
period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, 
care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged 
retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and 
possible hypoglycemia.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Concomitant FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and Oral 
Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients<paragraph>If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose 
of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> monotherapy, consideration should be given 
to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary 
failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (also 
known as glibenclamide). With concomitant FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and 
sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by 
adjusting the dose of each drug. However, attempts should be made to identify 
the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of 
hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be 
increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken (see Package Insert of the 
respective sulfonylurea).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of 
concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> 
and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives 
including switching to insulin with or without FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Concomitant FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and 
Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients<paragraph>The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> therapy. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> 
therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. 
For patients not responding adequately, the dose of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and 
by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The 
maximum recommended daily dose for FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> 
Extended-Release Tablets is 2500 mg. It is recommended that the insulin dose be 
decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to 
less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. Further adjustment should be individualized based on 
glucose-lowering response.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Specific Patient Populations<paragraph>FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> is not recommended for use in 
pregnancy, and is not recommended in patients below the age of 17 years.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The initial and maintenance dosing of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should 
be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for 
decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be 
based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, 
debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum 
dose of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic 
acidosis, particularly in the elderly (see <content styleCode="bold">

                     <content styleCode="bold">Q1. Why do I need to take FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Your doctor has prescribed FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> to treat your 
type 2 diabetes, a condition in which blood sugar (blood glucose) is elevated. 
There are two types of diabetes. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> is indicated 
for the most common type, known as type 2 diabetes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q2. Why is it important to control type 2 diabetes?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Type 2 diabetes has multiple possible complications, including blindness, 
kidney failure, and circulatory and heart problems. Lowering your blood sugar to 
a normal level may prevent or delay these complications.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q3. How is type 2 diabetes usually controlled?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of oral 
medications and by insulin injections. Your doctor may recommend that you try 
lifestyle modifications such as improved diet and exercise before initiating 
drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. Each patient will be treated individually by 
his or her physician, and should follow all treatment recommendations.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q4. Does FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> work differently 
from other glucose control medications?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Yes. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, as well as other formulations of 
metformin, lowers the amount of sugar in your blood by controlling how much 
sugar is released by the liver. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (metformin 
hydrochloride) does not cause your body to produce more insulin. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> rarely causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and it does not 
usually cause weight gain when taken alone. However, if you do not eat enough, 
if you take other medications to lower blood sugar, or if you drink alcohol, you 
can develop hypoglycemia. Specifically, when FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> is 
taken together with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, hypoglycemia and weight gain 
are more likely to occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q5. What happens if my blood sugar is still too high?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If your blood sugar is high, consult your physician. When blood sugar cannot 
be lowered enough by either FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (metformin 
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets or a sulfonylurea, the two medications 
can be effective when taken together. Other alternatives involve switching to 
other oral antidiabetic drugs (e.g., alpha glucoside inhibitors or glitazones). 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> may be stopped and replaced with other drugs 
and/or insulin. If you are unable to maintain your blood sugar with diet, 
exercise and glucose-control medications taken orally, then your doctor may 
prescribe injectable insulin to control your diabetes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q6. Why should I take FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> in 
addition to insulin if I am already on insulin alone?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Adding FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> to insulin can help you better 
control your blood sugar while reducing the insulin dose and possibly reducing 
your weight.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q7. Can FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> cause side 
effects?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, like all blood sugar-lowering medications, 
can cause side effects in some patients. Most of these side effects are minor 
and will go away after you've taken FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> for a 
while. However, there are also serious but rare side effects related to 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> (see below).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q8. What kind of side effects can FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> cause?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If side effects occur, they usually occur during the first few weeks of 
therapy. They are normally minor ones such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain 
and upset stomach. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> is generally taken with 
meals, which reduce these side effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although these side effects are likely to go away, call your doctor if you 
have severe discomfort or if these effects last for more than a few weeks. Some 
patients may need to have their doses lowered or stop taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>, either temporarily or permanently. You should tell your 
doctor if the problems come back or start later on during the therapy.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">WARNING: A rare number of people who have taken metformin 
have developed a serious condition called lactic acidosis. Properly functioning 
kidneys are needed to help prevent lactic acidosis. You should not take 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> if you have impaired kidney function, as 
measured by a blood test (see <linkHtml href="#section-14.1">Q9-13</linkHtml>).</content>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> rarely causes serious side effects. The most 
serious side effect that FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> can cause is called 
lactic acidosis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q10. What is lactic acidosis and can it happen to me?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Lactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the blood. Lactic 
acidosis associated with metformin is rare and has occurred mostly in people 
whose kidneys were not working normally. Lactic acidosis has been reported in 
about one in 33,000 patients taking metformin over the course of a year. 
Although rare, if lactic acidosis does occur, it can be fatal in up to half the 
cases.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is also important for your liver to be working normally when you take 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup>. Your liver helps to remove lactic acid from 
your bloodstream. Your doctor will monitor your diabetes and may perform blood 
tests on you from time to time to make sure your kidneys and your liver are 
functioning normally. There is no evidence that FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> 
causes harm to the kidneys or liver.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q11. Are there other risk factors for lactic 
acidosis?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Your risk of developing lactic acidosis from taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> is very low as long as your kidneys and liver are healthy. 
However, some factors can increase your risk because they can affect kidney and 
liver function. You should discuss your risk with your physician. You should not 
take FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> if:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Some of the symptoms include feeling very weak, tired or uncomfortable, 
unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, unusual or unexpected stomach 
discomfort, feeling cold, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, or suddenly developing a 
slow or irregular heartbeat. If you notice these symptoms, or if your medical

diarrhea and/or fever, or if your intake of fluids is generally reduced. These 
situations can lead to severe dehydration, and it may be necessary to stop 
taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> temporarily. You should let your doctor 
know if you are going to have any surgery or specialized x-ray procedures that 
require injection of contrast agents. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> therapy 
will need to be stopped temporarily in such instances.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Remind your doctor and/or pharmacist that you are taking FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> when any new drug is prescribed or a change is made in how 
you take a drug already prescribed. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> may

                  <paragraph>Tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant or have become pregnant. As 
with other oral glucose-control medications, you should not take FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> during pregnancy. Usually your doctor will prescribe insulin 
while you are pregnant.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> tablets should not be cut, crushed, or 
chewed and should be taken whole with a full glass of water once daily with the 
evening meal. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> may be eliminated as a soft mass in your stool that may look 
like the original tablet; this is not harmful and will not effect the way 
FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> works to control diabetes. FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> should be taken once a day with food. You will be started on 
a low dose of FORTAMET<sup>®</sup> and your dosage will be increased 
gradually until your blood sugar is controlled.</paragraph>
