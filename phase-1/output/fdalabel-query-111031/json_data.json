Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\n The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis \n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases.  These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.  Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.  Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of GLUMETZA.  In GLUMETZA-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions).  Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue GLUMETZA and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal Impairment:  The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.  The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating GLUMETZA, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \n\n\u2022GLUMETZA is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)]. \n\n\n\u2022Initiation of GLUMETZA is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2. \n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking GLUMETZA. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \n\n\u2022In patients taking GLUMETZA whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\nDrug Interactions:  The concomitant use of GLUMETZA with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis:  those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)].  Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or Greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n\n\u2022\nRadiological Studies with Contrast:  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop GLUMETZA at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart GLUMETZA if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and Other Procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment.  GLUMETZA should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\nHypoxic States:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).  Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia.  When such events occur, discontinue GLUMETZA.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive Alcohol Intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving GLUMETZA.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic Impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels.  Therefore, avoid use of GLUMETZA in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on GLUMETZA and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.  GLUMETZA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue.  Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with GLUMETZA [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUMETZA.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\n\n\n\nAdverse reactions occurring >5% in GLUMETZA clinical trials:  hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). \n\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u2011 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\u00a0\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\u00a0\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n1.\nRenal\u00a0impairment\u2014The\u00a0postmarketing\u00a0metformin-associated\u00a0lactic\u00a0acidosis\u00a0cases\u00a0primarily occurred in\u00a0patients with significant\u00a0renal\u00a0impairment.The\u00a0risk\u00a0of\u00a0metformin\u00a0accumulation\u00a0and\u00a0metformin-associated\u00a0lactic\u00a0acidosis\u00a0increases\u00a0with the\u00a0severity of renal\u00a0impairment\u00a0because\u00a0metformin\u00a0is\u00a0substantially\u00a0excreted\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0kidney.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n2.\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age\u00a0because\u00a0elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n3.\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n4.\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n5.\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n6.\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n7.\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory\u00a0evidence of\u00a0hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0no\u00a0clinical\u00a0studies\u00a0establishing\u00a0conclusive\u00a0evidence\u00a0of\u00a0macrovascular\u00a0risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are\u00a0also discussed elsewhere in the\u00a0labeling:\n\n\n1.Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n2.Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n3.Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\u00a0metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets,\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0common\u00a0adverse\u00a0reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion,\u00a0abdominal\u00a0discomfort,\u00a0and\u00a0headache.\u00a0(6.1)\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets \n\nIn a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets up to 2,550 mg per day.

(5.2)\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues:  Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

(5.1)\n\n\n\u2022\nIf lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended. (5.1)", "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nLactic Acidosis: See boxed warning. (5.1)\n\n\u2022\nVitamin B12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2)\n\n\u2022\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis \n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5\u00a0mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets \u2011 treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\n\u00a0The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\u2022\nDrug Interactions: The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n\n\u2022\nRadiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re\u2011evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\nHypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Adverse reactions occurring >5% in metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trials: hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

In the add-on to sulfonylurea study, patients receiving background glyburide therapy were randomized to receive add-on treatment of either one of three different regimens of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo. In total, 431 patients received metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide and 144 patients received placebo and glyburide.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP.

In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS).\n         \n \n  \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress.

When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \n\u2265\n 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

(5.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUMETZA and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>\u00a05\u00a0mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is approximately 0.03\u00a0cases/1000\u00a0patient-years, with approximately 0.015\u00a0fatal cases/1000\u00a0patient-years. In more than 20,000\u00a0patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking GLUMETZA. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. GLUMETZA treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, GLUMETZA should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, GLUMETZA should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking GLUMETZA, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, GLUMETZA should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis (In controlled trials, 32% and 67% for adjunctive treatment in adults and pediatric patients, respectively, and 15 to 25% for monotherapy of epilepsy, with decrease in serum bicarbonate to less than 20\u00a0mEq/L; 3% and 11% for adjunctive treatment in adults and pediatric patients, respectively, and 1 to 7% for monotherapy of epilepsy, with decrease in serum bicarbonate to less than 17\u00a0mEq/L) and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis. (See 7.1 Drug Interactions and 12.5 Clinical Pharmacology) The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis.\n\n\nPatients should be educated to promptly report these symptoms should they occur. If present, GLUMETZA should be withdrawn until lactic acidosis is ruled out. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of GLUMETZA, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to recur. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5\u00a0mmol/L in patients taking GLUMETZA do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly-controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking GLUMETZA, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170\u00a0mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS (4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Monitoring of Renal Function\n\n\nMetformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Therefore GLUMETZA is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.\nBefore initiation of GLUMETZA and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated (e.g.,\u00a0elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and GLUMETZA discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis.\n\nUse of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition\u00a0- Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)), should be used with caution.\nRadiological studies and surgical procedures:\nRadiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, GLUMETZA should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48\u00a0hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.\nGLUMETZA therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoxic States\n\n\nCardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on GLUMETZA therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Alcohol Intake\n\n\nAlcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving GLUMETZA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Impaired Hepatic Function\n\n\nBecause impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis GLUMETZA should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Vitamin B12 Levels\n\n\nIn controlled, 29-week clinical trials of immediate release metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of GLUMETZA or Vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on GLUMETZA and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate Vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal Vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum Vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7 Hypoglycemia\n\n\nHypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.8 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUMETZA or any other oral anti-diabetic drug.", "6.

In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling.

In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\u2022 Renal impairment \u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\no Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\no Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\no Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\no Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\no In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022 Drug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022 Age 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022 Surgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022 Hypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022 Hepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\u2022 Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\u2022 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 year to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4\tMacrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.

Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis.

Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions).

In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions - The concomitant      use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific      drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those      that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change,      interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation.      Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater - The risk of      metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac      impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in      elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast - Administration of      intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute      decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior      to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR      between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of      hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will      be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and      restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function      is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures  -      Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may      increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment.      Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily      discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states  - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart      failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).      Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When      such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release      tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake - Alcohol      potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should      be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment - Patients with      hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may      be due to      impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with      clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [\n         \n \n  \nsee Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets \n         \n \n  [\n          \n  \n   see Drug Interactions (7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Boxed Warning and \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12Deficiency \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \n\u2265\n 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.  Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio.  When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also \n        \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful.

When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/ 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

(5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\n\nRenal Impairment\n\n\n\nThe postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]:\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release      tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are      contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2\n[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] .\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release      tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45      mL/minute/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for      the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function      should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2,      assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\n\nDrug Interactions\n\n\n\nThe concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\n\nAge      65 or Greater\n\n\n\nThe risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)]. \n\n\n\n\nRadiological      Studies with Contrast\n\n\n\nAdministration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\n\n\nSurgery      and Other Procedures\n\n\n\nWithholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\n\nHypoxic      States\n\n\n\nSeveral of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\n\u00a0 \nExcessive Alcohol Intake\n\n\n\nAlcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u00a0 \nHepatic Impairment \n\n\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n\n\n\nAdverse reactions occurring >5% in metformin hydrochloride clinical trials: hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u2011associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In metformin hydrochloride oral solution treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride oral solution, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain  an  eGFR  at  least  annually  in  all  patients  taking  metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride oral solution, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain  an  eGFR  at  least  annually  in  all  patients  taking  metformin hydrochloride oral solution.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride oral solution at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride oral solution if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol  intake  \u2014  Alcohol  potentiates  the  effect  of  metformin  on  lactate metabolism.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\n The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found. \n\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). \n\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \nDosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]:\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see \nContraindications (4)\n]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\u00a0Drug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride. \n\u00a0Hepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment  \u2014 The postmarketing      metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients      with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \nDosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\u25cb\u00a0 Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\u25cb\u00a0 Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see \nContraindications (4)\n].\n\u25cb\u00a0 Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\u25cb\u00a0 Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\u25cb\u00a0 In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of      metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk      of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function,      result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base      balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent      monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014The risk of      metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age      because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic,      renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function      more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration      of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients      has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of      lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or      prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR      between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of      hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will      be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48      hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride      tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of      food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk      for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin      hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients      have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing      cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of      acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by      hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute      myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with      hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal      azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride      tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates      the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned      against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride      tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment      have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be      due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood      levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in      patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\u00a0Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see\u00a0Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see\nBoxed Warning      and Warnings and Precautions      (5.1)\n ]\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and      Precautions (5.2)]\nHypoglycemia [see\nWarnings and Precautions      (5.3)\n ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets.

Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients\n\u2265\n       \n \n  80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions : The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast :  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.

Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications.\u00a0 Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.\u00a0 In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function.\u00a0 Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.\u00a0 Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin \nhydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The\u00a0 patient and\u00a0 the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.\u00a0(See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.\u00a0 Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metforminassociated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment \u2013 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\n\u00a0The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\n\noBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\noMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n [see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\noInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\noObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\noIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2013 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2013 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2013 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2013 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2013 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2013 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2013 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \nDosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see \nContraindications (4)\n].\nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B12\u00a0 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on Metformin Hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets [see \n\nDrug Interactions (7)\n\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2) \n\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release\u00a0tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride\u00a0extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12\nDeficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride\u00a0or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with\nConcomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning\n and\n Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>                               5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >                               5 mcg/mL are generally found. \n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also                                     PRECAUTIONS).                               \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also                                     PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug-related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.                               \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also                                     PRECAUTIONS.)                               \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). \n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age\u00a0because\u00a0elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory\u00a0evidence of\u00a0hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 M\nacrovascular Outcomes \n\n\nThere\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0no\u00a0clinical\u00a0studies\u00a0establishing\u00a0conclusive\u00a0evidence\u00a0of\u00a0macrovascular\u00a0risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are\u00a0also discussed elsewhere in the\u00a0labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\u00a0metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets,\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0common\u00a0adverse\u00a0reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion,\u00a0abdominal\u00a0discomfort,\u00a0and\u00a0headache.\u00a0(6.1)\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience\n\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets \n\nIn a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets up to 2,550 mg per day.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12\nDeficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets arecontraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2\n[see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\n\nDrug Interactions: The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n\nRadiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re\u00adevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin\nB12 Levels\n\nIn controlled, 29-week clinical trials of immediate release metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or Vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate Vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal Vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum Vitamin B12 measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia\n\nHypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta\u00adadrenergic blocking drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular\nOutcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or any other oral anti-diabetic drug.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe incidence and type of adverse reactions reported by greater than 5% of patients for the combined\u00a0metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets group versus placebo group are hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

In the add-on to sulfonylurea study, patients receiving background glyburide therapy were randomized to receive add-on treatment of either one of three different regimens of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo. In total, 431 patients received metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide and 144 patients received placebo and glyburide. A serious adverse reaction was reported in 2.1% (9/431) of the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide-treated patients compared to 1.4% (2/144) of the placebo and glyburide-treated patients. When the data from the monotherapy and add-on to sulfonylurea clinical trials were combined, the most frequently (incidence greater than or equal to 0.5 %) reported serious adverse reactions classified by system organ class were gastrointestinal disorders (1.0% of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients compared to 0% of patients not treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets) and cardiac disorders (0.4% of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients compared to 0.5% of patients not treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Only 2 serious adverse reactions (unstable angina [n=2] and pancreatitis [n=2]) were reported in more than one metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patient.\nAdverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets that were more common in the combined metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide group than in the placebo and glyburide group are shown in Table 1.\nIn 0.7% of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide, diarrhea was responsible for discontinuation of study medication compared to no patients in the placebo and glyburide group.\n\nTable 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported By Greater Than 5%* of Patients for the Combined Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Groups Versus Placebo Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Reaction\n\n\n\n\nMetformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets + Glyburide (n = 431)\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo + Glyburide (n = 144)\n\n\n\n\n\nHypoglycemia\n\n\n13.7%\n\n\n4.9%\n\n\n\n\nDiarrhea\n\n\n12.5%\n\n\n5.6%\n\n\n\n\nNausea\n\n\n6.7%\n\n\n4.2%\n\n\n\n\n* ARs that were more common in the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated than in the placebo-treated patients.\n\n\nLaboratory Tests\n\nVitamin B12 concentrations\nMetformin may lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.

Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also ). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also ). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n                                        PRECAUTIONS\nPRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also .)\n                                        PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2)\n\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\45abd94e-142e-4da8-ad7b-566a18395935.xml": ["Lactic Acidosis:\n\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride tablets;   when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \n\u03bcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride \ntablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/ L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.  Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio.  When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also \n        \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS).\n       \n \n  \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also \n        \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n       \n \n  \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also \n        \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS).\n       \n \n  \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).\u00a0 In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted.\u00a0 Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis \n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release. In metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release if renal function is stable. \n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release. \n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release. \n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride/metformin hydrochloride extended release, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions : The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast :  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\tLactic Acidosis  \n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablet treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see\u00a0\nDosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n\n\noBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \n\noMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see\u00a0\nContraindications (4)\n]. \n\noInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \n\noObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \n\noIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable. \n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets. \n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets. \n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\tVitamin B12 Deficiency  \n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablet clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\u00a0\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues  \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)\n]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4\tMacrovascular Outcomes  \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)\n]\n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)\n]\n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also \n         \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS).\n        \n  \n   \nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also \n         \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n        \n  \n   \nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also \n         \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS).\n        \n  \n   \nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets/ metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\5fb922d2-e71b-4f67-847e-92d820ebc3d6.xml": ["Lactic Acidosis\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \n\u2265\n 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.  Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.  Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets.  In Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions).  Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal Impairment:  The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney.  Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \n\n\u2022Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2\n [see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\n\u2022Initiation of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2. \n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \n\n\u2022In patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\nDrug Interactions:  The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis:  those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)].  Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or Greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n\n\u2022\nRadiological Studies with Contrast:  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and Other Procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment.  Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\nHypoxic States:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).  Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia.  When such events occur, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive Alcohol Intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic Impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels.  Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3   Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022 Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\n\u2022 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\n\u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse reactions occurring >5% in Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets clinical trials: hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/ 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS  and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels.

Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

In the add-on to sulfonylurea study, patients receiving background glyburide therapy were randomized to receive add-on treatment of either one of three different regimens of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo.

A serious adverse reaction was reported in 2.1% (9/431) of the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide-treated patients compared to 1.4% (2/144) of the placebo and glyburide-treated patients. When the data from the monotherapy and add-on to sulfonylurea clinical trials were combined, the most frequently (incidence greater than or equal to 0.5 %) reported serious adverse reactions classified by system organ class were gastrointestinal disorders (1.0% of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients compared to 0% of patients not treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets) and cardiac disorders (0.4% of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients compared to 0.5% of patients not treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets).

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (\n>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasmalevels >5 mcg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatalcases/1000 patient-years). \n\n\nReported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients >80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (\n            \n  \n   see also \n             \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS\n).\n           \n \n  \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (\n            \n  \n   see also \n             \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS\n). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n           \n \n  \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin\n do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (\n            \n  \n   see also \n             \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS\n).\n           \n \n  \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (\n            \n  \n   see also \n             \n   \n    CONTRAINDICATIONS and \n             \n   \n    PRECAUTIONS\n).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n\n\n\nExtended-Release Metformin Clinical Studies\n\nIn the controlled clinical studies of extended-release metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 424 patients received extended-release metformin therapy (up to 2500 mg/day) and 430 patients received immediate-release metformin.

Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\u00a0[see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\64e767dc-f4a7-42c7-83f3-4be9aef2dca9.xml": ["Lactic Acidosis:\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).\u00a0 In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted.\u00a0 Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets/ metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.

Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2)\n\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found. \n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.\n\n\nBecause impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking Metformin Hydrochloride, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.) \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). \n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

(5.2)\n\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).\u00a0 In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.

Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\u00a0[see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/ L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \nDosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see \nContraindications (4)\n].\nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B12\u00a0 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on Metformin Hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets [see \n\nDrug Interactions (7)\n\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\n The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment - The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [\n         \n \n  \nsee Dosage and Administration (2.1)\n, \n         \n \n  \nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]:\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [\n          \n  \n   \nsee Contraindications (4)\n ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions - The concomitant      use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific      drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those      that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change,      interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation.      Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater - The risk of      metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac      impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in      elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast - Administration of      intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute      decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior      to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR      between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of      hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will      be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and      restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function      is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures  -      Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may      increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment.      Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily      discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states  - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart      failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).      Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When      such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release      tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake - Alcohol      potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should      be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment - Patients with      hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may      be due to      impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with      clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [\n         \n \n  \nsee Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets \n         \n \n  [\n          \n  \n   see Drug Interactions (7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Boxed Warning and \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12Deficiency \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\7abc2154-fe12-5c55-e053-2991aa0aaaa1.xml": [], "xml-files\\7ac4b965-1cfa-4d0d-bcac-51ad644ce616.xml": ["Lactic Acidosis:\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases.  Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.  Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio.  When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n\n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n\n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n\n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \n  \nDosage and Administration (2.2)\n, \n  \nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]:\n \n\n\no Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\no Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n  2 [see \n  \nContraindications (4)\n].\n \no Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n  2.\n \no Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\no In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see \n   \nDrug Interactions (7)\n]. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12 Deficiency\n       \n\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Drug Interactions (7)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [\n        \n  \n   see \n         \n   \n    Boxed Warning and \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)\n]\n       \n \n  \nVitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [\n        \n  \n   see \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)\n]\n       \n \n  \nHypoglycemia [\n        \n  \n   see \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)\n]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance. \n         \n \n    (6.1)\n\n\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Qingdao BAHEAL Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. at\u00a01-888-968-2865 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or \n          \n  \n     www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Clinical Studies Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nIn placebo-controlled trials, 781 patients were administered metformin HCl extended-release tablets.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also \n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS).\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also \n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also \n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS.)\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions).

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)\n, \nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [\nsee Contraindications (4)].\n\nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the\ndevelopment of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk\nof continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum\nvitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12\nabsorption from the  B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with\ndiscontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate\nvitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n         \n \n  Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n         \n \n  For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n        \n\n \n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.

The onset of metformin  associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\n\nRisk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.\n\n\nSteps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.7), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]", "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment - The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \nsee Dosage and Administration (2.1)\n, \n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]:\n        \n\n \n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [\n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   \nsee Contraindications (4)\n ].\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions - The concomitant      use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific      drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those      that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change,      interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation.      Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater - The risk of      metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac      impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in      elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast - Administration of      intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute      decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior      to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR      between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of      hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will      be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and      restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function      is stable.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures  -      Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may      increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment.      Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily      discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states  - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart      failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).      Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When      such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release      tablets.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake - Alcohol      potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should      be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment - Patients with      hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may      be due to      impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with      clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin\u00a0HCl is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets and by use of the minimum effective doses of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin\u00a0HCl on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also \nPRECAUTIONS\n).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also \nPRECAUTIONS\n). Metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also \nPRECAUTIONS\n.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin\u00a0HCl extended release tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin\u00a0HCl is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n          \n  \n   \n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \n          \n  \n   \nDosage and Administration (2.1), \n           \n   \n    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n          \n  \n   \n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2 [see \n            \n    \n     \nContraindications (4)\n].\n           \n   \n    \nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2.\n           \n   \n    \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n           \n   \n    \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n         \n \n  \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n         \n \n  \n Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n         \n \n  \n For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n        \n\n \n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [\n         \n \n  \nsee Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n          \n  \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2 [see \n            \n    \n     \nContraindications (4)\n\n].\n\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2.\n           \n   \n    \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. \nIn patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n           \n   \n    \n\n\n\nDrug interactions\u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater\u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast\u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging \u00a0\u00a0procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures\u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states\u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake\u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment\u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014The postmarketing      metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients      with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions  \u2014 The concomitant use of      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may      increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that      impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere      with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug      Interactions (7)] . Consider more frequent      monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater  \u2014 The risk of      metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age      because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic,      renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function      more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast  \u2014      Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in      metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function      and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated      contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60      mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic      impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be      administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours      after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures  \u2014 Withholding of      food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk      for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued      while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states  \u2014 Several of the postmarketing      cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of      acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by      hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute      myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with      hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal      azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake  \u2014 Alcohol      potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should      be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment  \u2014 Patients with hepatic      impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.      This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate      blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence      of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and      Precautions (5.1) ]\nVitamin B12 \u00a0Deficiency [see Warnings and      Precautions (5.2) ]\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/ 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS  and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\n\n\tThe postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n   \n\tThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n   Dosage and Administration (\n    2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n    12.3)\n   ]:\n\n\t\n   \nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n     2\n[see Contraindications (\n      4)]. \n     \n\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n     2 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n     2.\n    \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n     2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n    \n\n\n\nDrug interactions\n\n\tThe concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n  \n\nAge 65 or greater\n\n\tThe risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast\n\n\tAdministration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures\n\n\tWithholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n  \n\nHypoxic states\n\n\tSeveral of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake\n\n\tAlcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n  \n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\tPatients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n 12 Deficiency\n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n  12 absorption from the B\n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see \n  Adverse Reactions (\n   6.1)\n  ].\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n   7)]. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis \n   [see \n    Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n    5.1)] \n   \n\nVitamin B\n   12 Deficiency \n   [see Warnings and Precautions (\n    5.2)] \n   \n\nHypoglycemia \n   [see Warnings and Precautions (\n    5.3)] \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets/ metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.

This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism.

There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS).

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \n Dosage and Administration\n (2.1) and\nClinical Pharmacology \n(12.3)\n]\n\nBefore initiating Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets\u00a0is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications\n (4)]\nInitiation of\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk ofcontinuing therapy.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment.\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see \nAdverse Reactions\n\n(6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n          \n  \n   \n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \n          \n  \n   \nDosage and Administration (2.1), \n           \n   \n    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n          \n  \n   \n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2 [see \n            \n    \n     \nContraindications (4)\n].\n           \n   \n    \nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2.\n           \n   \n    \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12\u00a0 supplementation.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>                              \n         \n \n   5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >                              \n         \n \n   5 mcg/mL are generally found. \n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also                                     \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS).                               \n         \n \n  \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also                                     \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug-related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.                               \n         \n \n  \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also                                     \n          \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS.)                               \n         \n \n  \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). \n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting.

Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12 Deficiency\n       \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation.

Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n          \n  \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]\n         \n \n  : \n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2 \n[see \n           \n   \n    Contraindications (4)]\n          \n  \n   . \n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release\u00a0tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2. \n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n          \n  \n   \n\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride\u00a0extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n          \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12\nDeficiency\n       \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride\u00a0or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation.

Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of  gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

( 5.1)\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Vitamin B12\u00a0Deficiency:  Metformin may lower vitamin B12\u00a0levels. Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2)\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues:  Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Metformin  associated   lactic   acidosis   was   characterized   by    elevated    blood    lactate    levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nRisk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.\nSteps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.7), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].     \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].", "5.1 Lactic Acidosis\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin  associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n  \nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n  \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n \n  Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n  \n  Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n  \n  Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging   procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n  \n  Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n  \n  Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n  \n  Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n  \n  Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n \n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n  Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]\n  \n  Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n  \n  Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n \n6.1 Clinical Studies Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nMetformin Hydrochloride Tablets\nIn a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets up to 2550 mg per day.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n          \n  \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]\n         \n \n  : \n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2 \n[see \n           \n   \n    Contraindications (4)]\n          \n  \n   . \n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2. \n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n          \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12\nDeficiency\n       \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]\n         \n \n  .\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with\nConcomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Drug Interactions (7)]. \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis \n        \n  \n   [see \n         \n   \n    Boxed Warning\n and\n        \n  \n   \n Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n        \n  \n   \n\nVitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency \n        \n  \n   [see \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n        \n  \n   \n\nHypoglycemia \n        \n  \n   [see \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n        \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory\u00a0evidence of\u00a0hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 M\nacrovascular Outcomes \n\n\nThere\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0no\u00a0clinical\u00a0studies\u00a0establishing\u00a0conclusive\u00a0evidence\u00a0of\u00a0macrovascular\u00a0risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are\u00a0also discussed elsewhere in the\u00a0labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\u00a0metformin hydrochloride tablets / metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets,\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0common\u00a0adverse\u00a0reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion,\u00a0abdominal\u00a0discomfort,\u00a0and\u00a0headache.\u00a0(6.1)\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience\n\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets \n\nIn a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets up to 2,550 mg per day.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n          \n  \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]\n         \n \n  : \n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2 \n[see \n           \n   \n    Contraindications (4)]\n          \n  \n   . \n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2. \n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n          \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12\nDeficiency\n       \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \n\u2265\n 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin      secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment:  The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions : The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast :  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metforminassociated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized byelevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 g/mL are generally found.The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients >80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. ln addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should beinstructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized onany dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found. \n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.\n\n\nBecause impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.) \n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). \n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n          \n  \n   \n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \n          \n  \n   \nDosage and Administration (2.1), \n           \n   \n    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n          \n  \n   \n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2 [see \n            \n    \n     \nContraindications (4)\n].\n           \n   \n    \nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2.\n           \n   \n    \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n           \n   \n    \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12\u00a0 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include: \n \n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n \n\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n \n\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n \n\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n \n\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n \n\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n \n\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n \n\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].\n \n\n\n\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].\n \n\n\n\nMacrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride.", "The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\nLactic Acidosis [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]\nHypoglycemia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]\n\n\n\nClinical Studies Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n \nIn a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride up to 2550 mg per day.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis.

Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment.

(\n     5.3)\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include \n  [see \n   Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]\n  :\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2 \n[see \n    Contraindications (4)]\n   .\n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2.\n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n   \n\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n 12 Deficiency\n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n  12 absorption from the B\n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B\n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities \n  [see \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]\n  .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with\nConcomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Drug Interactions (7)]. \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis \n   [see \n    Boxed Warning\n and \n   \n Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n   \n\nVitamin B\n   12 Deficiency \n   [see \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n   \n\nHypoglycemia \n   [see \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n  \n\n\n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n  \n\n\n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n  \n\n\n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n \n\n\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n  \n\n\n\n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [ \n  \nsee Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] \n  :\n \n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see \n   Contraindications (4)].\n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m \n   2.\n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions\u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n  \n\nAge 65 or greater\u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast\u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging   procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures\u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n  \n\nHypoxic states\u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake\u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n  \n\nHepatic impairment\u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n  12 Deficiency\n \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n  12 absorption from the B\n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see \n  Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see \n  \nDrug Interactions (7)\n].\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n  \n\n\u2022 Lactic Acidosis [see \n  \nBoxed Warning\nand \n  \nWarnings and Precautions (5.1)\n]\n  \n\n\u2022 Vitamin B\n  12 Deficiency [see \n  \nWarnings and Precautions (5.2)\n]\n  \n\n\u2022 Hypoglycemia [see \n  \nWarnings and Precautions (5.3)\n]\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\n The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metforminassociated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n          \n  \n   The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include \n          \n  \n   [see \n           \n   \n    Dosage and Administration (2.1), \n           \n   \n    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]\n          \n  \n   :\n          \n  \n   \nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2 \n[see \n             \n     \n      Contraindications (4)]\n            \n    \n     .\n           \n   \n    \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2.\n           \n   \n    \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n            \n    \n     2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n           \n   \n    \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12 Deficiency\n       \n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities \n         \n \n  [see \n          \n  \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]\n         \n \n  .\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In metformin hydrochloride oral solution-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride oral solution, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride oral solution at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra- arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride oral solution if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride oral solution.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3-year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride oral solution and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride oral solution may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with\u00a0metformin hydrochloride oral solution\u00a0[see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride oral solution.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)\n]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n        \n\n \n        \n\n \n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney.

Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater\u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast\u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   \n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging \u00a0\u00a0procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures\u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states\u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake\u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment\u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  \n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B\n        \n\n 12 Deficiency\n       \n\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum\nvitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12\nabsorption from the  B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with\ndiscontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate\nvitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure\nhematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on Metformin Hydrochloride\nand manage any abnormalities \n         \n \n  [\n          \n  \n   see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets \n         \n \n  [\n          \n  \n   see Drug Interactions (7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Metformin\nHydrochloride Tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Boxed Warning and \n         \n   \n    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n        \n  \n   \n\nVitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n        \n  \n   \n\nHypoglycemia \n        \n  \n   [\n         \n   \n    see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n        \n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications.\u00a0 Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.\u00a0 In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function.\u00a0 Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.\u00a0 Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The\u00a0 patient and\u00a0 the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.\u00a0(See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see \nDosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]: \n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see \nContraindications (4)\n].\nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B12\u00a0 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on Metformin Hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.1)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets [see \n\nDrug Interactions (7)\n\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin     or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1   Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\u00a0\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\u00a0\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\u00a0\n For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\u00a0The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\u00a0\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2\n[see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\n\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.\n\n\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\n\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below.\n\n\n45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug Interactions: The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\n\nAge 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n\n\n\nRadiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\n\nSurgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\n\nHypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\n\nExcessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\n\n\nHepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\u00a0\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets\u00a0[see Drug Interactions (7)].\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \n\nLactic     Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12     Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse reactions occurring >5% in metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trials: hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

In the add-on to sulfonylurea study, patients receiving background glyburide therapy were randomized to receive add-on treatment of either one of three different regimens of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets\u00a0or placebo. In total, 431 patients received metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets\u00a0and glyburide and 144 patients received placebo and glyburide.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \n>\n80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see \n         \n \n  Dosage and Administration (\n          \n  \n   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (\n          \n  \n   12.3)]\n         \n \n  :\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2[see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (\n           \n   \n    4)\n          \n  \n    ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\u00a0 \n          \n  \n   Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B\n         \n \n  12 absorption from the B\n         \n \n  12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see\n         \n \n   Adverse Reactions (\n          \n  \n   6.1)\n         \n \n  ].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet \n         \n \n  [see Drug Interactions (\n          \n  \n   7)].\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [see\n        \n  \n   Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.1\n )]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Vitamin B\n        \n  \n   12 Deficiency [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.2)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [see\n        \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n         \n   \n    5.3)\n        \n  \n    ]\n       \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\b01de40c-1f85-4255-bcf2-31540bca206a.xml": ["WARNINGS\n\n\n\n\n\nLactic Acidosis:\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\n The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \n\noIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\tVitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues  \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)\n]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4\tMacrovascular Outcomes  \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)\n] \n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)\n] \n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)\n] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance (6.1)\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact \nMylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX)\n or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1\tClinical Studies Experience  \n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nIn placebo-controlled trials, 781 patients were administered metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions).

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/ 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.\u00a0 Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\u00a0  If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets, treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [\u00a0\nsee  Dosage and Administration (2.1),\n\u00a0\n\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]:\n\u00a0\nO Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\nO Metformin hydrochloride tablet is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\u00a0\n[see  Contraindications (4) ]\n\u00a0. \nO Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablet is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nO Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets.\u00a0 In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nO In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\nDrug interactions\u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater\u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast\u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures\u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states\u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake\u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nHepatic impairment\u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\u00a0\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure of hematologic parameters on an annual basis vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities \u00a0\u00a0\n[see  Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablets \u00a0\n[see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n5.4 \nMacrovascular outcomes\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLactic Acidosis: See boxed warning.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis \n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet\u00a0and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\nRenal Impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:o\u00a0 Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).o \u00a0Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].o\u00a0 Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.o \u00a0Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal\u00a0impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.o In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\nDrug Interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or Greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic Studies With Contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and Other Procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic States \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nExcessive Alcohol Intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nHepatic Impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency \n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets\u00a0may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes \n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00adassociated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. \u00a0Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12\u00a0Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)\n]\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance.

Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride\u00a0extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12\nDeficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride\u00a0or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with\nConcomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning\n and\n Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment - The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n         \n \n  \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [\n         \n \n  \nsee Dosage and Administration (2.1)\n, \n         \n \n  \nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n]:\n        \n\n \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [\n          \n  \n   \nsee Contraindications (4)\n ].\n         \n \n  \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2.\n         \n \n  \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\nDrug interactions - The concomitant      use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific      drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those      that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change,      interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation.      Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nAge 65 or greater - The risk of      metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac      impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in      elderly patients.\n         \n \n  \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast - Administration of      intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute      decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior      to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR      between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n          \n  \n   2; in patients with a history of      hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will      be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and      restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function      is stable.\n         \n \n  \n\nSurgery and other procedures  -      Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may      increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment.      Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily      discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n         \n \n  \n\nHypoxic states  - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart      failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).      Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When      such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release      tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nExcessive alcohol intake - Alcohol      potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should      be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin      hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n         \n \n  \n\nHepatic impairment - Patients with      hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may      be due to      impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with      clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n         \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B\n         \n \n  12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\d31309f3-7bb9-4a57-bbaf-90ef80ded009.xml": ["Lactic Acidosis: \n\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended \u00a0in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain \u00a0an\u00a0 eGFR \u00a0at \u00a0least \u00a0annually\u00a0 in \u00a0all \u00a0patients \u00a0taking\u00a0 metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function\u00a0and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHypoxic\u00a0\nstates \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\n\nExcessive \u00a0alcohol \u00a0intake \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Alcohol\u00a0 potentiates\u00a0 the\u00a0 effect\u00a0 of\u00a0 metformin\u00a0 on\u00a0 lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHepatic \u00a0impairment \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Patients \u00a0with \u00a0hepatic \u00a0impairment \u00a0have \u00a0developed \u00a0cases \u00a0of\u00a0metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12\u00a0levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12\u00a0supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12\u00a0or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12\u00a0levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12\u00a0at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n\nCholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."], "xml-files\\d7609164-67b9-4116-a2ef-630d967d5252.xml": ["Lactic Acidosis\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases.\u00a0 Lactic\u00a0acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.

In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.\u00a0 Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin \nhydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress.

In particular, treatment of the elderly \nshould be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET\u00ae treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of \nage unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function \nis not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic \nacidosis. In addition, FORTAMET\u00ae should be promptly \nwithheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, \ndehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly \nlimit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET\u00ae should \ngenerally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic \ndisease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either \nacute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET\u00ae, since alcohol \npotentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In \naddition, FORTAMET\u00ae should be temporarily discontinued \nprior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure \n(see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and \naccompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory \ndistress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may \nbe associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more \nmarked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the \npossible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to \nnotify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). FORTAMET\u00ae should be \nwithdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood \nglucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin \nlevels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of \nFORTAMET\u00ae, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common \nduring initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence \nof gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious \ndisease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper \nlimit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking FORTAMET\u00ae do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may \nbe explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or \nobesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling \n(see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient \nwith metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and \nketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated \nin a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking \nFORTAMET\u00ae, the drug should be discontinued immediately \nand general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin \nhydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good \nhemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the \nacidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in \nprompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nEnter section text here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFORTAMET\u00ae Clinical Studies\n\nIn the controlled clinical studies of FORTAMET\u00ae in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 424 patients \nreceived FORTAMET\u00ae therapy (up to 2500 mg/day) and 430 \npatients received immediate-release metformin.

Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2) \n\n\u2022\n Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis  \n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u2011associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET ER. In RIOMET ER treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET ER and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment - The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\u2022Before initiating RIOMET ER, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022RIOMET ER is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\u2022Initiation of RIOMET ER is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET ER. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking RIOMET ER whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions - The concomitant use of RIOMET ER with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater - The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast - Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop RIOMET ER at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart RIOMET ER if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures - Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. RIOMET ER should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue RIOMET ER.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake - Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving RIOMET ER.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment - Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of RIOMET ER in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency   \n\nIn clinical trials of 29 week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on RIOMET ER and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues  \n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. RIOMET ER may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with RIOMET ER [see Drug Interactions (7)].", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/ 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metforminassociated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\n\u2022\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\u2022Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n\u2022Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)].\n\n\u2022Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n\u2022Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n\n\u2022In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\n\u2022\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\u2022\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\u2022\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\u2022\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\u2022\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\u2022\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\n\u2022Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\n\n\u2022Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n\n\u2022Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients \n\u2265\n 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.

Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2) \n\nHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12\nDeficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with\nConcomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning\n and\n Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated      lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant      renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4) ].\nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in      patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin      hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal      impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more      frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of      continuing therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0 Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\u00a0 Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\u00a0 Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging\u00a0\u00a0 procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.\n\u00a0 Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\u00a0 Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\u00a0 Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n\u00a0 Lactic Acidosis [seeBoxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1\n )]\n\u00a0 Vitamin B12 Deficiency [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n\u00a0 Hypoglycemia [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients\n\u2265\n       \n \n  80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also \n        \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS).\n       \n \n  \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also \n        \n  \n   PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n       \n \n  \n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.

In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin.

Lower dose of insulin      or insulin      secretagogue may be      required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00a0 associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\n\n\nThe postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets, obtain an      estimated glomerular filtration      rate (eGFR).\nMetformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets are contraindicated in      patients with      an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n[\nsee      Contraindications (4)].\n\nInitiation of      metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR      between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to      45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride      extended-release tablets. In patients at risk for the      development of renal impairment      (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed      more frequently.\nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR falls      below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions\n\n\nThe concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\nAge 65 or greater \n\n\nThe risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \n\n\nAdministration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL/min/1.73 m2and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n\nSurgery and      other procedures\n\n\nWithholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n\nHypoxic states \n\n\nSeveral of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\nExcessive alcohol      intake\n\n\nAlcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving\u00a0 metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n\nHepatic impairment \n\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B12 supplementation.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling.

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. \n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: \n\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. \n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. \n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride. \n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride. \n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see\u00a0Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. \nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. \nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: \n\nBefore initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \nMetformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n[see Contraindications (4)]. \nInitiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. \nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \nIn patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. \n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. \n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12\nDeficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with\nConcomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \n\nLactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning\n and\n Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (> 5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is\nsignificant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic\nacidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u03bcg/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin Hydrochloride is very low\n(approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patientyears). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride by use of the minimum effective dose of Metformin Hydrochloride. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied\nby careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin Hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, Metformin Hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, Metformin Hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned  against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking Metformin Hydrochloride, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin Hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure\n (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such\nas malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible\nimportance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin Hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful.

Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in\npatients taking Metformin Hydrochloride do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.

Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride. In Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n\nRenal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. \n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n\nBefore initiating Metformin Hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\nMetformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n [see Contraindications (4)].\n\nInitiation of Metformin Hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nObtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\nIn patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n\n\nDrug interactions \u2014 The concomitant use of Metformin Hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\nAge 65 or greater \u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast \u2014 Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop Metformin Hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Metformin Hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n\nSurgery and other procedures \u2014 Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states \u2014 Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake \u2014 Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment \u2014 Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn Metformin Hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of Metformin Hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on Metformin Hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.", "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis [see  Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n\nVitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\nHypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/ 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient\u2019s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients \u226580 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). \n\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient\u2019s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).", "ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn a U.S. double-blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo.
